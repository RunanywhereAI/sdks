# RunAnywhere Voice Demo - Vue 3

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧

A Vue 3 demonstration of the RunAnywhere Voice SDK, showcasing real-time voice processing capabilities in web browsers.

## Status

This Vue demo application is currently under development and not yet functional. The implementation is planned to include:

- 🎤 **Real-time Voice Processing**: Complete VAD → STT → LLM → TTS pipeline
- ⚡ **Ultra-low Latency**: Target <500ms end-to-end response time
- 📊 **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics dashboard
- ⚙️ **Configuration Panel**: Adjust models, voices, and features
- 🎨 **Modern Vue UI**: Responsive design with Vue 3 composition API
- 📱 **Mobile Ready**: Works on tablets and mobile devices

## Current Issues

- ❌ Build compilation errors with `useVoicePipeline` composable
- ❌ Import/export issues with Vue package distribution
- ❌ TypeScript configuration needs adjustment
- ❌ Component integration not yet complete

## Planned Features

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── VoiceAssistant.vue     # Main voice interface
│   ├── SettingsPanel.vue      # Configuration panel
│   └── MetricsDashboard.vue   # Performance metrics
├── composables/
│   └── useVoiceDemo.ts        # Main demo logic composable
└── types/
    └── demo.types.ts          # TypeScript definitions
```

### Vue 3 Features
- **Composition API**: Modern reactive state management
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **Single File Components**: Scoped styles and template compilation
- **Reactive Voice Pipeline**: Real-time state updates

## Development Status

This demo is currently **not buildable** and requires the following work:

1. **Fix Vue Package Exports**: Resolve `useVoicePipeline` import issues
2. **Component Implementation**: Create Vue-specific voice components
3. **Composable Logic**: Port React hooks to Vue composables
4. **TypeScript Integration**: Ensure proper type definitions
5. **Build Configuration**: Fix Vite and Vue compilation

## Quick Start (When Ready)

```bash
# Install dependencies (currently fails)
cd examples/web/vue-demo
pnpm install

# Start development server (not working yet)
pnpm dev

# Build for production (not working yet)
pnpm build
```

## Architecture Plan

The Vue demo will follow similar patterns to the React demo but with Vue-specific implementations:

- **Composables instead of hooks**: `useVoicePipeline`, `useVoiceSettings`
- **Vue reactivity**: `ref()`, `reactive()`, `computed()`
- **Template-driven UI**: Declarative Vue templates
- **Scoped styling**: Vue single-file component styles

## Browser Support (Planned)

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 90+
- Safari 15+
- Edge 90+

## Contributing

This demo is currently in early development. Contributions welcome once basic compilation issues are resolved.

# Phase 7: Core Voice Assistant Integration

## Overview

**Phase**: 7 (Next Phase)
**Focus**: Get the complete voice pipeline working end-to-end
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Goal**: Working voice assistant with real conversations (VAD → STT → LLM → TTS)

## Current Status

**Prerequisites Completed:**
- ✅ Complete SDK architecture (11 packages building successfully)
- ✅ React demo application (production-ready UI)
- ✅ VAD service working with real audio
- ✅ TTS service functional with Web Speech API
- ✅ Service implementations ready for integration

## Phase 7 Objectives

### Single Focus: Get Voice Conversations Working

**What we have**: ✅ VAD (working) + ✅ TTS (working) + ✅ React UI (working) + ⚠️ STT/LLM services (ready)

**What we need**: Connect the missing pieces to enable real voice conversations

1. **Whisper STT Integration**
   - Load Whisper model with @xenova/transformers
   - Connect audio from VAD to STT service
   - Get real transcription working

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Connect to OpenAI API for responses
   - Wire STT output to LLM input
   - Get streaming responses working

3. **Complete the Pipeline**
   - User speaks → VAD detects → STT transcribes → LLM responds → TTS speaks
   - Test actual voice conversations
   - Fix any integration issues

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Make It Work
**Goal**: Get voice conversations working in the React demo

- **Days 1-3**: STT Integration
  - Configure @xenova/transformers Whisper model loading
  - Connect VAD audio output to STT service
  - Test "hello world" transcription working

- **Days 4-5**: LLM Integration
  - Connect transcription to OpenAI API
  - Get basic question/answer working
  - Test streaming responses

- **Days 6-7**: End-to-End Testing
  - Complete voice conversation flow
  - User speaks → gets AI response spoken back
  - Fix integration bugs

### Week 2 (Optional): Polish
**Goal**: Make it work reliably

- **Days 1-3**: Fix issues and improve UX
- **Days 4-7**: Documentation and cleanup

## Success Criteria

### Core Goal: Voice Conversations Work
- ✅ User can speak to the React demo
- ✅ Their speech gets transcribed accurately
- ✅ AI generates relevant responses
- ✅ AI response is spoken back to user
- ✅ Can have back-and-forth conversations

### Demo Experience
- Open React demo → Click voice button → Say "Hello" → Hear AI respond
- Basic conversation flow working smoothly
- Reasonable response time (under 3-5 seconds total)

## What This Achieves

After Phase 7, we'll have:
- **Working voice AI assistant** that people can actually talk to
- **Complete proof of concept** demonstrating the full pipeline
- **Foundation for advanced features** - once conversations work, everything else is enhancement

**Focus**: Make the basic voice conversation experience work first. No complex features, just get people talking to AI and AI talking back.
